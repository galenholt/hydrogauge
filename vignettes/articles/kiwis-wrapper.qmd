The [fetch_kiwis_timeseries()] function wraps [find_ts_id()] (which itself wraps [getTimeseriesList()]) and [getTimeseriesValues()], which allows some extra functionality and smoother workflows but also introduces some danger and sometimes inefficiency. Some argument names have been changed compared to [getTimeseriesValues()] (which gives the user full access to KiWIS names) for more clarity and to move towards a unified interface across both API styles.
