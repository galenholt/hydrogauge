Description: This package provides R wrappers to (some) of the API calls possible to the Kisters Kiwis and Hydstra APIs. Its focus was initially for Victoria, Australia using Hydstra, and is best-tested there, but expansion to BOM has brought in KiWis. Both are likely to be generic across other jurisdictions using these services. I have tried to provide functionality to query available options for the different arguments.
